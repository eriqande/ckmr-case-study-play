This is a repository of Rmarkdown documents that Eric put together, along with
Anna Simeon from UW, when working to get their heads around different CKMR case
studies that have been published recently.  

There seems something of a lack of good data archiving for some of these recent
ckmr examples, so, in some cases, we are just simulating data here based on the
inferential model used in the paper, and then playing with the resulting simulated
data, and writing TMB models for doing the inference.

This is far from complete or reproducible at the moment. Planning to add `renv` package
control to it to make it easier for others to explore the options here.
